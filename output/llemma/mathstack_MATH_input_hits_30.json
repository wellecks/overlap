Analysis is known to be a hard class, but I want to stress that it's difficulty is not because of it's material, but rather out of virtue of tests and quizzes. Quizzes are often much more difficult, focusing on understanding of material, rather than application of a formula. This guide will provide some practice problems, some created by me, and some from other sources such as college textbooks and math olympiads.\n\nI've also tried to emphasize two key parts of the Analysis syllabus. The first is an understanding of patterns, which is critical in the first few units. Finding a pattern is the key to answering a difficult problem, and is often what starts groundbreaking mathematical research. Take Fermat's last theorem, for example.\n\n\\begin{thrm}\n    For all integers $x, y,z,$ and $n$, the equation\n    \\[x^n + y^n = z^n\\]\n    has no real solutions for all values of $n > 2$.\n\\end{thrm}\nFermat, a 17th century mathematician, noticed a pattern, and made this conjecture. However, it took a whopping 358 years to finally prove this theorem, leading to the second part of mathematics. At it's core, math is about rigorous \\textit{proof}, which is what makes it so interesting. It's not just about reaching a solution, but instead about elegantly showing your work in a way that shows that you \\textit{cannot} be wrong.\n\nAnalysis works on proofs in most of what's covered, and this study guide has an extra focus on it, mainly because I think understanding where a theorem comes from is as important as knowing it. A big chunk of the class, as I already stated, is focused on applying the concepts that you learn, which you can't do unless you have a really strong foundation with each idea.\n\n\\subsection{Notes on Notation}\nI use standard mathematical notation which you may not be familiar with just yet. Here's a rundown of the most important symbols:\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l}\n\t$\\ZZ$ & the integers & $\\NN$ & the natural numbers & $\\RR$ & the real numbers \\\\\n    $\\CC$ & the complex numbers & $\\PP$ & the prime numbers & $\\varnothing$ & the empty set \\\\\n    $\\forA$ & for all & $\\isE$ & there exists & $\\mid$ & such that \\\\\n\t$\\to$ & implies $(p \\to q)$ & $\\in$ & is an element of & $\\Re, \\Im$ & real and imaginary \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\noindent Therefore, we can write something like\n\\[\\forA x \\in \\QQ, \\isE y \\in \\ZZ \\mid xy \\in \\ZZ\\]\nwhich would mean\n\\begin{center}\n\tFor all rational numbers $x$, there is an integer $y$ such that $xy$ is an integer.\n\\end{center}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Sets}\nProblem sets are given at the end of each section, roughly in ascending order of difficulty. You should at least attempt each problem, but do not be discouraged if you cannot solve it. I've labeled each problem with a sort of ``difficulty marking\", which can be seen as follows.\n\n\\begin{center}\n    \\fbox{\\parbox{0.715\\textwidth}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{llll}\n        \\multicolumn{2}{l}{Problem Indicators:} &  0 & Very easy, quickly solvable \\\\\n        & & 10 & Easy, homework difficulty \\\\\n        & & 20 & Average, short answer difficulty \\\\\n        HM & Higher Math & 30 & Hard, free response difficulty \\\\\n        CS & Computer Science & 40 & Very hard, olympiad difficulty \\\\\n        $\\blacktriangleright$ & Important & 50 & Unsolved problem\n    \\end{tabular}\n    }}\n\\end{center}\n\nThe higher math problems require math concepts we haven't covered in class yet, but you may have learned them (either on your own or in previous classes). For example, problems which require functions will always be marked as \\textit{HM} until unit 4 (functions). CS Application problems usually involve algorithm design ideas, and they can be interesting especially if you're taking a CS class. Finally, ``important\" questions are ones to definitely attempt, since they're popular on quizzes and tests.\n\n\\subsection*{Sample Problem Set}\n\n\\begin{problem}[\\important 00]\n    What would (CS30) mean?\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[10]\n    Show that in right triangle $ABC$, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[CS15]\n    Find \\textit{SUM} in terms of $N$ from the following algorithm.\n    \\begin{algo}[Double Sum to $N$]\n    \\textbf{Input:} $N$, \\textbf{Output:} $S$\n    \\begin{algorithm}[H]\n    \tDoubleSum$(a,b)$:\n    \t\n    \t$S \\setto 0$\n    \t\\For{$i \\setto 1$ \\KwTo $N$}\n      \t{\n        \t\\For{$j \\setto 1$ \\KwTo $i$}\n\t\t  \t{\n\t\t    \t$S \\setto S + j$\n\t\t  \t}\n      \t}\n\t\\end{algorithm}\n\t\\end{algo}\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[HM\/CS50]\n    Determine if all problems which can be quickly verified can be quickly solved.

Here we'll cover things like elementary number theory, combinatorics, and algebra.\n\n\\subsection{Pascal's Triangle}\n\nPascal's triangle is a useful tool to look at things such as \\textit{binomial expansions}, \\textit{combinations}, or \\textit{series}. To get introduced to this, we'll start with the definition of a factorial.\n\\begin{defn}\n\tFor positive integers $n$, $n!$ is defined as $n(n-1)(n-2)\\dots3\\times2\\times1$.\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Interestingly enough, we can say that $n! = n \\times (n-1)!$, meaning that $5! = 5\\times 4!$.\n\nNow we can go about explaining Pascal's triangle. Make sure you have a solid foundation with factorials!\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n  &    &    &    &    &  1 &    &    &    &    &   \\cr\n  &    &    &    &  1 &    &  1 &    &    &    &   \\cr\n  &    &    &  1 &    &  2 &    &  1 &    &    &   \\cr\n  &    &  1 &    &  3 &    &  3 &    &  1 &    &   \\cr\n  &  1 &    &  4 &    &  6 &    &  4 &    &  1 &   \\cr\n1 &    &  5 &    & 10 &    & 10 &    &  5 &    & 1 \\cr\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\\begin{question}\n    What patterns can you find in the triangle? Spend some time looking through and exploring it.\n\\end{question}\nThe first pattern we notice is that each term is the sum of the two terms above it. For example, taking the 3rd term of the 5th row, which has a value of 6, we take the two values above it (3 and 3), and add them.\n\nTerms in Pascals Triangle are represented by a notation called \"choose notation\". We let the \"first row\" be the row with two ones, and the \"zeroth row\" be the row with one one. We then go down from there, so that the row 1\\quad 2\\quad 1 is the second row. This is simple, the second row has a second term of 2, the third has a second term of 3, the fourth 4, etc. For saying the \"nth\" term in a row, we say that the first 1 is the 0th term, the second number is the 1st term, and so on. Therefore, we introduce choose notation as follows:\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\t$\\binom{n}{k}$ (read as $n$ \\textit{choose} $k$) refers to the $n$th row and $k$th term for all $n \\geq k, n,k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, referring to the triangle above,\n\n\\[\\binom{4}{2} = 6.\\]\nThe formula for this, which we call binomial notation, is\n\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}.\\]\nWe also know that each term in Pascals Triangle is equal to the sum of the two above it. Therefore,\n\n\\begin{thrm}[Pascal's Rule]\n\tFor all $n,k > 0, \\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}$.\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n\tProceeding by using the definition presented above,\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t\\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k} &= \\frac{(n-1)!}{((n-1) - (k-1))!(k-1)!} + \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n - k - 1)!k!} \\\\\n\t\t&= \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n - k)!(k-1)!} + \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n - 1 - k)!k!}.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tWe multiply the left fraction by $\\frac{k}{k}$ and the right by $\\frac{n-k}{n-k}$\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t&= \\frac{(n-1)!k}{(n - k)!k!} + \\frac{(n-1)!(n-k)}{(n - k)!k!}.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tAdding these, we find that\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t&= \\frac{(n-1)!k+(n-1)!(n-k)}{(n-k)!k!} \\\\\n\t\t&= \\frac{(n-1)!(k+n-k)}{(n-k)!k!} \\\\\n\t\t&= \\frac{(n-1)!n}{(n-k)!k!} \\\\\n\t\t&= \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} \\\\\n\t\t&= \\binom{n}{k}\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tfrom definition 1, and we are done.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\noindent Also, we see that Pascal's Triangle seems to be symmetric. Therefore,\n\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tFor all $n,k > 0, \\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}.$\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{question}\n    Can you prove Theorem 2.2?\n\\end{question}\nNext, another pattern which arises is that of the \\textit{binomial expansion}. This is an expansion of $(a+b)^n$, for integers $a, b$ and $n$.\n\n\\begin{thrm}[Binomial Theorem]\n\tFor integers $a$ and $b$, and positive integer $n$, we can say that\n\t\\[(a+b)^n = \\binom{n}{0}a^nb^0 + \\binom{n}{1}a^{n-1}b^1 + \\binom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^2 + \\dots + \\binom{n}{n-1}a^1b^{n-1} + \\binom{n}{n}a^0b^n.\\]\n\tThus, the coefficients of each term in $(a+b)^n$ lines up with the $n$th row of Pascals Triangle.\n\\end{thrm}\nThe proof of this theorem will be explored in a later section, since we don't have the methods to prove it yet.\n\nThe theorem says that for some two numbers, the power of their sum is given by the above expression. We can apply this to a few binomials.\n\n\\[(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\]\n\\[(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\]\nNow, we can move on to problems. For these, I recommend using small cases in order to determine a pattern. For example\n\n\\begin{example}\n\tThe sum of each term in the 47th row of Pascals Triangle can be written as $x^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. Find $x + y$. \\textit{Hint}: Test smaller cases first.\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    We look for a pattern\n    \n    \\begin{align*}\n    \t\\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{2}{1} + \\binom{2}{2} = 1 + 2 + 1 &= 4 \\\\\n    \t\\binom{3}{0} + \\binom{3}{1} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{3} = 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 &= 8 \\\\\n    \t\\binom{4}{0} + \\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{4}{3} + \\binom{4}{4}= 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 &= 16\n    \\end{align*}\n    and we find one! It seems to be that for the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle, the sum of each row is $2^n$. Therefore, we can say that the sum of the $47$th row is $2^{47}$, so $x = 2$ and $y = 47$, and we have $2 + 47 = \\boxed{49.}$\n\\end{solution}\n\n\\begin{remark} Note that just because we noticed a pattern, we cannot truly say that it works. In order to do this, we must write a formal, rigorous proof of the claim.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection*{Pascal's Triangle Problems}\n\\begin{problem}[10]\n    Find $\\binom{3}{3}+\\binom{4}{3} + \\binom{5}{3} + \\dots + \\binom{37}{3}$.\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[15]\n    Expand $(x^4 + \\frac{1}{3y^2})^4$ using the binomial theorem.\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[\\important 20]\n    What is the coefficient of the term with $x\\cdot y^{15}\\cdot z^{6}$ in the expansion of $\\left(13x^{11}+7y^{5}+3z^{2}\\right)^{17}$?\n    \\begin{hint}\n        Group the terms to form a binomial.\n    \\end{hint}\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[25]\n    Prove that the sum of each element in the $n$th row is $2^n$.

Originally, the sequence was devised as a way to determine the size of rabbit populations by Leonardo Bonacci in the 12th century.\\footnote{Fibonacci comes from \\textit{filius Bonacci}, or `son of Bonacci'. Also, he most definitely did not invent it - it was first attested by Pingala, an Indian mathematician and linguist in 450 B.C. See \\url{https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/0315086085900217} for more.} We define it as follows:\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\tLet $F_n$ be the $n$th Fibonacci number. Then, defining $F_1$ as 1, and $F_2$ as 1, we recursively define $F_n$ as \t\t$F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, the fifth Fibonacci number is\n\n\\[F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = F_3 + F_2 + F_2 + F_1 = F_2 + F_1 + F_2 + F_2 + F_1 =  5.\\]\nAs you can see, this process is slightly tedious, and gets far worse for larger numbers. We can write this in java as\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption = fibby.java]\npublic class fibby {\n\tpublic int fibonacci(int n) {\n\t\t\/\/ fibonacci(1) = 1, the recursive base\n\t\tif (n <= 1)\n\t\t\treturn n;\n\t\t\/\/ definition of fibonacci\n\t\telse\n\t\t\treturn fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);\n\t}\n}\\end{lstlisting}\n\nUnfortunately, this runs in $\\bigo(2^N)$ time, which is... very bad. However, we can find an exact answer for the $n$th Fibonacci using Binet's formula, below.\n\n\\begin{thrm}[Binet's Formula]\n\tThe $n$th Fibonacci number can be found from \\[F_n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt 5}\\]\n\\end{thrm}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nExamine the quadratic equation\n\\[x^2=x+1.\\]\nWe note that the roots of this quadratic are $\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\n\\noindent Next, it is easy to verify that \\[x^n=F_nx+F_{n-1}.\\] Letting the roots be $\\alpha=\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2}$ and $\\beta=\\frac{1-\\sqrt 5}{2},$ they must satisfy the equation above.\n\n\\noindent Therefore,\n\\[\\alpha^n=F_n\\alpha+F_{n-1}\\] and \\[\\beta^n=F_n\\beta+F_{n-1}.\\]\nSubtracting the two equations, we have that\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\alpha^n-\\beta^n &= F_n(\\alpha-\\beta)+F_{n-1}-F_{n-1} \\\\\n\t\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^n &= F_n \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2} - \\frac{1-\\sqrt 5}{2}\\right) \\\\\n\tF_n &= \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt 5}\n\\end{align*}\nas was desired.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\noindent We call the value $\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ the ``golden ratio\", represented by the greek letter $\\phi$ (spelled ``phi,\" pronounced ``fee\"). It has some interesting properties, which we won't examine in this guide, but feel free to look them up for yourself!\\footnote{Check out \\url{https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golden_ratio} for some good starting points.} Also, please do \\textit{not} memorize Binet's Formula. It's pretty much useless, and will never show up on a test. One interesting property of $\\varphi$, however, is that\n\\[\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} = \\varphi,\\]\nwhich is interesting.\\footnote{See \\url{www.math.hawaii.edu\/~pavel\/fibonacci.pdf} for a proof using linear algebra.}\n\nUsing the recursive algorithm for Fibonacci numbers (recursive means defined by itself), we can list out the first few numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. I'd recommend memorizing these.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}\n\t$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 &4 & 5 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t$F_n$ & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13 & 21 & 34\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\nNow, let's think about a few properties of the Fibonacci Sequence. The first one that obviously arises is:\n\n\\begin{example}\n\tFind the sum of the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers. That is, find 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + $F_n$.\n\\end{example}\nAs always, start with finding a pattern. Letting the sum be notated as $S_n$,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\tS_1 = F_1 &= 1 \\\\\n\tS_2 = F_1 + F_2 &= 2 \\\\\n\tS_3 = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 &= 4 \\\\\n\tS_4 = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 + F_4 &= 7 \\\\\n\tS_5 = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 + F_4 + F_5 &= 12\n\\end{align*}\nand it looks like we've found one. It seems that $S_1 = F_3 - 1, S_2 = F_4 - 1, S_3 = F_4 - 1,$ and so on. Therefore, we say\n\n\\begin{prop}\n\tThe sum of $n$ Fibonacci numbers is $F_{n+2} - 1$.\n\\end{prop}\n\nRemember, this is a conjecture, not a theorem, as we have not yet proved it to be true for \\textit{all} real numbers $n$. We can now move on to some problem sets.\n\nMost Fibonacci problems, unlike other sections in the class, simply rely on memorizing formulas. There are, however, problems where you'll have to deduce a pattern on a test.\n\nOutside of these problems, come up with your own conjectures for other interesting Fibonacci patterns. Try to write proofs for them, and check if they hold against edge cases.\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\subsection*{Fibonacci Number Problems}\n\\begin{problem}[\\important 10]\n    Find the value of $\\binom{10}{0} + \\binom{9}{1} + \\binom{8}{2} + \\binom{29}{3} + \\dots + \\binom{5}{5}$.\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[\\important 20]\n    Given two positive integers $n$ and $k$, find the value of $F_{n+k}$ in the form of $F_aF_b+F_cF_d$\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[15]\n    Find positive integers $p$ and $q$ such that $F_{2021}^2 - F_{2017}^2 = F_pF_q$\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[30]\n    Find the infinite sum $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{27} + \\cdots + \\frac{F_n}{3^n} + \\cdots$ (Mandelbrot).\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[35]\n    Find a positive integer $a$ such that $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^{17} + bx^{16} + 1$ (1988 AIME \\#13).\n\\end{problem}\n\n\\subsection{Factorials!}\nThe last part of this unit is factorials. We've already briefly covered them, so here's a more formal definition.\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\t$n!$ is the product of all natural numbers $k$ such that $0 < k \\leq n$. In other words, $n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...3\\times2\\times1,$ and we let $0! = 1$.\n\\end{defn}\nThere aren't many theorems concerning factorials at this level, so we'll dive straight into an example.\n\n\\begin{example}\n\tEvaluate $1!(1) + 2!(2) + 3!(3) + ... + 17!(17),$ then find a compact expression for $n$ numbers.\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution} As always, we look for a pattern:\n\\begin{align*}\n\t1!(1) = 1(1) &= 1 \\\\\n\t1!(1) + 2!(2) = 1 + 4 &= 5 \\\\\n\t1!(1) + 2!(2) + 3!(3) = 1 + 4  + 18 &= 23 \\\\\n\t1!(1) + 2!(2) + 3!(3) + 4!(4) = 1 + 4  + 18 + 96 &= 119\n\\end{align*}\nand we find that our value is always $(n+1)! - 1$, so for $n=17$, our sum is $\\boxed{18!-1}.$\n\\end{solution}\n\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tFor all positive integers $n$, the sum $1!(1) + 2!(2) + 3!(3) + 4!(4) + ... + n!(n) = (n+1)! - 1$.\n\\end{thrm}\nThis proof will be explored in one of the coming sections, but for now, take it to be true.

Over the course of this section, we'll cover things like patterns, sums, and the concept of infinity.\n\n\\subsection{Sequences}\nThroughout math, we see ``sequences\", like $1,2,3,4,...$, the Fibonacci Sequence, or the sequence of prime numbers.\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\tA sequence is an ordered list of items which allows repetition.\n\\end{defn}\nTherefore, the sequence $1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4$ is not the same as $4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1$. This differs from a set, since a sequence \\textit{is ordered} and \\textit{allows repetition}. In math, we're mostly concerned with sequences of numbers, so much so that we define two special types of series.\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\tAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term, $a_n$, is separated by a constant common difference.\n\\end{defn}\n\nFor example, the sequence $1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ...$ is arithmetic, with a common difference of 3. We call this common difference $d \\in \\mathbb{R}.$ Therefore, $48, 31, 14, -3$ is a progression with difference $-17$.\n\nLet's try to find a compact expression for the $n$th term in an arithmetic sequence. First, look for a pattern. Let's start with the simple sequence $1, 2, 3, 4\\dots$ with $a_1 = 1$ and $d = 1$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\ta_1 = 1 &= a_1 + 0 \\\\\n\ta_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 &= a_1 + 1 \\\\\n\ta_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 &= a_1 + 2 \\\\\n\ta_4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 &= a_1 + 3 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nA pattern is revealed! For the $n$th term, we simply add the difference multiplied by $n-1$ to the first term, giving us that $\\boxed{a_n = a_1 + d(n-1)}$.\n\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tFor an arithmetic sequence with common difference $d$, the $n$th term is given by $a_n = a_1 + d(n-1)$, where $a_1$ is the first term.\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n\tStart by indexing at $a_0$ instead of $1$. Then, the second number in the sequence becomes $a_0 + d$, from the definition of an arithmetic sequence. Next, the third number is $a_2 = a_1 + d$, which can be simplified into $a_0 + d + d = a_0 +2d$. This occurs recursively, giving us that $a_n = a_0 + nd$. However, we must adjust for the shifted index. Therefore, $n$ is replaced by $n-1$, giving us $a_n = a_1 + d(n-1),$ and we are done.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{remark}\n\tAs you just saw, proofs aren't always just algebraic manipulation. Instead, we can find an elegant solution like the one above, which just entails thinking about a problem in a new way.\n\\end{remark}\nNow, we'll look at the other interesting type of sequence, called a geometric sequence.\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\tA geometric sequence is a sequence in which each term $a_n$ is separated by a constant common ratio.\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, the sequence $1, 3, 9, 27, ...$ is geometric, with a common ratio of 3. The ratio $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is common to all numbers, and can be negative or fractional. Now, as above, let's find a compact expression for a geometric sequence with ratio $r$. Start with looking for a pattern in the sequence $1, 2, 4, 8...$\n\\begin{align*}\n\ta_1 = 1 &= a_1 \\times 2^0 \\\\\n\ta_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 &= a_1 \\times 2^{1} \\\\\n\ta_3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 &= a_1 \\times 2^2 \\\\\n\ta_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 +  4 = 8 &= a_1 \\times 2^3 \\\\\n\ta_n = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... &= \\boxed{a_1 \\times 2^{n-1}.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{prop}\n\tFor a geometric sequence with common ratio $r$, the $n$th term is $a_n = a_1 \\times r^{n-1}$.\n\\end{prop}\nThis proof will be an problem later on, but keep this claim in mind. Finally, let's consider some \\textit{infinite} sequences that go on forever. In particular, we're interested in their end behavior.\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\tAn infinite sequence $\\mathcal{S}$ is said to diverge if, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, $\\mathcal{S}$ approaches a constant value $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\\end{defn}\nThis is also known as taking the \\textit{limit} as $n$ approaches $\\infty$, notated as $\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\mathcal{S},$ which will be explored more in second semester. An example of a sequence that converges is the geometric sequence with ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$. Let's look at what happens to $\\mathcal{S}$ as we go on:\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}\n\t$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 &4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t$a_n$ & 1 & $\\frac{1}{2}$ & $\\frac{1}{4}$ & $\\frac{1}{8}$ & $\\frac{1}{16}$ & $\\frac{1}{32}$ & $\\frac{1}{64}$\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\nEvery value gets smaller, slowly approaching $0$. In fact, that gives us the following theorem:\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tA geometric sequence converges to zero if and only if the common ratio has an absolute value less than 1.\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n\tLet $a_1$ be the first term, and $r$ be the ratio. Then, since $|r| < 1,$ $r$ can be written as $\\frac{1}{k}$ for some real number $k$. Therefore, we take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity to find the ``infinite\" term:\n\t\\[\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{a_1}{k^{n-1}} = 0,\\]\n\tbecause as $n$ becomes very large, so will $k$, and therefore, $\\mathcal{S}$ will become very small, approaching zero, and we are done.\n\\end{proof}\n\nSometimes, we are given sequences that are not arithmetic or geometric, and we must find if they converge or diverge.\n\n\\begin{example}\n\tDoes $\\dfrac{n^2 - 2n +1}{2n^2 - 3n + 1}$ converge? If it does, what does it converge to?\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution} We can break the fraction into more manageable parts. The easiest way to see if something converges is to get $n$ in the denominator, because then as $n$ gets very large, $\\mathcal{S}$ gets very small. Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\frac{n^2 - 2n +1}{2n^2 - 3n + 1} &= \\frac{n^2 - 2n +1}{2n^2 - 3n + 1} \\times \\frac{\\frac{1}{n^2}}{\\frac{1}{n^2}} \\\\\n\t&= \\frac{\\frac{n^2 }{n^2} - \\frac{2n}{n^2} +\\frac{1}{n^2}}{\\frac{2n^2 }{n^2} - \\frac{3n}{n^2} + \\frac{1}{n^2}} \\\\\n\t&= \\frac{1 - \\frac{2}{n} +\\frac{1}{n^2}}{2 - \\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n^2}}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $n$ is very large, fractions with $n$ in the denominator can be canceled, giving us\n\\begin{align*}\n\t&= \\frac{1 - \\cancel{\\frac{2}{n}} +\\cancel{\\frac{1}{n^2}}}{2 - \\cancel{\\frac{3}{n}} +\\cancel{ \\frac{1}{n^2}}} \\\\\n\t&= \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2},}\n\\end{align*}\nwhich is our answer.\n\\end{solution}\nHonestly, these problems are just looking at the asymptotic behavior of the function. Any ``top heavy\" function will diverge, any ``bottom heavy\" function will converge to zero, and any ``balanced\" function will converge to the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nLast of all (and least important) is the concept of an average. The arithmetic mean, is the average of $n$ numbers, and the geometric mean, is the $n$th root of the product of $n$ numbers.\n\\[\\text{a.m.} = \\frac{a_1 +a_2 + a_3 + \\dots + a_n}{n}\\]\n\\[\\text{g.m} = \\sqrt[n]{a_1\\times a_2\\times a_3\\dots\\times a_n}\\]\n\n\\subsection*{Sequences Problems}\n\\begin{problem}[\\important 00]\n    Which sequences, among arithmetic and geometric, converge?

Find the smallest possible value of $c$ (2014 AMC 12A \\#14).\n\\end{problem}\n\n\\subsection{Series}\nNext, we're interested in the sums of each value in these sequences. These are called \\textit{series}, the sum of each term in a sequence.\n\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tThe finite sum $S_n$ of a finite arithmetic sequence with first term $a_1$ and common difference $d$ is $\\frac{n(a_1+a_n)}{2}$ or $\\frac{n(2a_1+d(n-1))}{2}$.\n\\end{thrm}\\begin{proof}\n\tWe can see that $a_n = a_1 + d(n-1)$, therefore giving us that\n\t\\[a_n + a_1 = 2a_1 + d(n-1).\\]\n\tNow, considering $a_2 + a_{n-1}$, we see that\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\ta_2 + a_{n-1} &= a_1 + d + a_1 + d(n - 2) \\\\\n\t\t&= 2a_1 + d(1 + n - 2) \\\\\n\t\t&= 2a_1 + d(n-1) \\\\\n\t\t&= a_1 + a_n.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tDoing the same with $a_k + a_{n-k+1}$ for some $k \\in N$, we find that\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\ta_k + a_{n-k+1} & = a_1 + d(k-1) + a_1 + d(n - k) \\\\\n\t\t&= 2a_1 + d(k-1 + n - k) \\\\\n\t\t&= 2a_1 + d(n-1) \\\\\n\t\t&= a_1 + a_n.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tConsidering the series, we find that there are $n$ numbers, and therefore $\\frac{n}{2}$ pairs. Therefore, to find the sum, we simply multiply $a_1 + a_n$ by $\\frac{n}{2}$, giving us\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\tS_n &= \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2},\n\t\\end{align*}\n\twhich, substituting our value for $a_n$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$, gives us\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t&= \\frac{n(2a_1 + d(n-1))}{2},\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tas was desired.\n\\end{proof}\nWe can also find the sum of a geometric series.\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tThe sum of a geometric sequence with first term $a_1$ and common ratio $r$ is $a_1\\times\\frac{r^n-1}{r-1}$.\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n\tThe geometric series can expressed as follows:\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\ta_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_n &= a_1 + a_1\\times r + a_1\\times r^2 + a_1\\times r^3 + \\dots + a_1\\times r^{n-1} \\\\\n\t\t&= a_1(1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \\dots + r^{n-1}).\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tOne fundamental identity of polynomial division is that $\\frac{x^y - 1}{x - 1} = (x^{y-1} + x^{y-2} + \\dots + x^2 + x + 1)$. Therefore, we can substitute, giving us\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t&= a_1\\times\\frac{r^n-1}{r-1},\n\t\\end{align*}\n\twhich was to be proved.\n\\end{proof}\n\nThis extends to the case of infinite sums as well. The proof of this next theorem is relatively straightforward, as you will see.\n\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tAn infinite geometric series converges to $\\frac{a_1}{1-r}$ if and only if $|r| < 1$.\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n\tTake the formula from above, $a_1\\times\\frac{r^n-1}{r-1}$. If we let $|r|$ be less than one, as $n$ gets larger, $r^n$ will get much smaller. Thus, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, $r^n \\rightarrow 0$, meaning that our equation becomes $\\frac{-a_1}{r-1},$ simplifying into $\\frac{a_1}{1-r},$ which was to be proved.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe can now create a helpful thought process to determine if something converges or diverges. An arithmetic sequence or series will never converge, but will always go to positive or negative infinity. A geometric sequence converges to zero if and only if $|r| < 1,$ and a geometric series converges to $\\frac{a_1}{1-r}$ if and only if $|r| < 1$.\n\nNext, let's look at something called \\textit{summation notation}. This notation is incredibly helpful for writing infinite sums in shorthand. For those who have programmed, summations are identical to for loops. We write the greek letter $\\Sigma$ (sigma) to mean sum.\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n i = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n\\]\nThere are three parts to the above expression. The $i=1$ directly below the sigma is our ``index,\" which is what we count. The $n$ above it is our upper bound, and the $i$ is what we're operating with. Essentially, we look at what $i$ is at first, in this case, 1. Then, we operate on $i$ as shown to the right of the sigma - in this case, the operation is just $i$, but it could be something like $2i, 3i - 4,$ or even $\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^i j$. Then, we add $1$ to $i$, such that $i=2$, and perform the operation again. We repeat this process until $i = n$, our upper bound. Lets look at another example:\n\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{17} (k!\\times k)\\]\nEvaluating this, we get $1!1 + 2!2+ 3!3 + \\dots 17!17,$ which, from Theorem 10 (see last unit), is $18! - 1$. We can also use the index to mark subscripts, exponents, and various other important points. We can also replace the sigma with a capital pi ($\\Pi$) to represent a product, such that\n\n\\[\\prod_{i=1}^n i = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\dots \\times (n-1) \\times n = n!\\]\nHere are a few more examples.\n\n\\[\\sum_{j=0}^{10} (2j+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + 21 \\qquad\\quad \\sum_{i=0}^{21} F_i = F_1 + F_2 + \\dots F_{21}\\quad\\qquad\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{3^k} = 1 +\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\dots \\]\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^{10}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{10} k\\right) = \\underbrace{(1 + 2 + \\dots + 10) + (1 + 2 + \\dots + 10) + \\dots + (1 + 2 + \\dots + 10)}_{10 \\text{ times}} = 550\\]\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^{10}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{j} k\\right) = 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 +3) + \\dots + (1 + 2 + \\dots + 10) = 220\\]\nFinally, let's move on to convergence and divergence in series. This is relatively simple.\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tAn arithmetic series will always diverge.\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n\tLet the first term be $a_1$ and difference be $d$. Then, as $d$ is constant, the $n$th term is $a_1 + d(n-1)$. Taking the limit as $n$ approaches $\\infty$, this becomes $a_1 + d\\times\\infty,$ which is extremely large. Therefore, the series must keep getting larger in magnitude, and it diverges.\n\\end{proof}\n\\section*{Series Problems}\n\\begin{problem}[5]\n    Evaluate the following the sums.\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n\t\t\\item $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{9} {\\binom{10}{i}}$\n\t\t\\item $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{20} \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})$\n\t\t\\item $\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n (\\frac{1}{k+1}-\\frac{1}{k})$\n\t\t\\item $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{i(i+1)}$\n\t\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{problem}\n\\begin{problem}[10]\n    A grocer makes a display of cans in which the top row has one can and each lower row has two more cans than the row above it.

This unit finally switches to another textbook, and here we'll learn about proof by induction, probability, expected value, and combinatorics.\n\n\\subsection{Induction}\nProofs are \\textit{the} single most important thing in math, since they let you actually state a fact \\textit{as a fact}. In this section, we're learning about a type of proof called induction. It works like this:\n\\begin{defn}[Induction]\n    Here, $k$ refers to some random constant in the domain.\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item Let the statement be expressed by a function $\\mcP(n)$.\n        \\item Establish a base case by evaluating $\\mcP(0)$ (or whatever your lowest value is), and showing that it holds with the hypothesis.\n        \\item (Inductive Hypothesis) Next, assume that $\\mcP$ holds for some value called $k$.\n        \\item With step 3 in mind, prove that $\\mcP(k+1)$ holds, \\textit{if} $\\mcP(k)$ holds.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{defn}\nThis is kind of abstract, so I'll use this as an example.\n\\begin{thrm}\n\tFor all real numbers $n,$ the sum from $1$ to $n$ is equal to $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. In other words,\n\t\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.\\]\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n    Define $\\mcP$ such that\n    \\[\\mcP(n): \\sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.\\]\n\tWe start with a base case of $1$.\n\t\\[\\mathcal{P}(1) = \\sum_{i=0}^1 i = 1 = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2},\\]\n\twhich holds true. Next, we assume that\n\t\\[\\mathcal{P}(k) = \\sum_{i=0}^k i = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2},\\]\n\tfor some constant $k$. Our goal is now to prove that\n\t\\[\\mathcal{P}(k+1) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} i = \\frac{(k+1)(k+ 1 + 1)}{2}\\]\n\tis true, given our above hypothesis. We do the following\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t \\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} i &= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + k + k + 1.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tHowever, we know that $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots  + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ from our hypothesis, which lets us plug our hypothesis in. Then,\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + k + k + 1 &= \\mathcal{P}(k) + k + 1 \\\\\n\t\t &= \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) \\\\\n\t\t &= \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \\frac{2(k+1)}{2}  \\\\\n\t\t &= \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2},\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tand we are done by induction.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWhy does this work? Since we have proved that our function works for $1,$ this must be true. Next, since we proved that it works for $k+1$ given that $k$ is true, we can assume that $k = 1$. Then $k+1 = 2$ must be true, and thus $(k+1) + 1 = 3$ must be true, and so on. Therefore, it is true for all integers $\\geq$ our base case.\n\nWhy do we care? It seems pretty clear that a proof using direct methods is far simpler. However, looking at more complex proofs, this becomes much less obvious. Let's do another example.\n\n\\begin{example}\n\tConsider the sequence $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, . . . defined by $a_0 = 3$ and $a_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)^2+1$. Find, with proof, a compact expression for $a_n$.\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    As always, proof starts with patterns. We find that\n    \\begin{align*}\n    \ta_0 = 3 &= 2^1 + 1 \\\\ a_1 = 5 &= 2^2 + 1 \\\\ a_2 = 17 &= 2^{4} + 1\\\\ a_3 = 257 &= 2^8 + 1\\\\ a_4 = 65537 &= 2^{16}+1,\n    \\end{align*}\n    giving us that $\\boxed{a_n = 2^{2^n} + 1}$ (fun fact, this is known as the $n^{th}$ Fermat number).\n\\end{solution}\n\\begin{prop}\n\tThe sequence defined above can be compactly described by $2^{2^n} + 1$.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\n\tWe use induction. As usual, we start with the base case, which is $n = 0$. This amounts to checking that $a_0$, which is defined to be 3, is equal to $2^{2^0} + 1$, which is also 3.

The universal set, $U,$ is the set of all elements being discussed.\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, let $A$ be the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}.$ We say that $n(A)$ is $4,$ as there are $4$ elements in $A$. We can use the notation\n\\[1 \\in A\\]\nto mean that $1$ is an element of $A$. If we let $U$ be all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+},$ we can also say that\n\\[A \\subseteq U,\\]\nmeaning that $A$ is a subset of $U,$ as all elements of $A$ are elements of $U$. In addition, we can say $A \\subset U,$ meaning that $A$ is a \\textit{proper} subset of $U,$ as it is a subset such that $A \\neq U$. However, if we say $U$ is $\\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}, x \\leq 4,\\}$ we must say that $A \\not\\subset U,$ but we can still say $A \\subseteq U.$\n\\begin{defn}\n\tThe complement of a set, denoted by $A'$ or $A^{C},$ is the set of all elements in $U$ which are not in $A.$\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, letting $U$ be $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\},$ and $A$ be $\\{1,2,3,4\\},$ we say that $A'$ is $\\{5\\}.$ Furthermore, we define the \\textit{empty set,} $\\varnothing,$ to be the set which has no elements. In that respect, if $A = U,$ we have that $A' = \\varnothing.$\n\nThe elements of a set can be anything, including numbers, words, and even other sets. For example, we could have some set $T = \\{5, \\{2,\\pi\\}, \\text{Boston}\\},$ which would be a valid set. Indeed, there is a special kind of set, called a power set, which contains all subsets of a set. For example, if $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\},$ we have that\n\\[\\mathscr{P}(A) = \\{\\varnothing, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,3\\} \\{1,2,3\\}\\}\\]\nWe can also perform operations on sets, two of which we are interested in.\n\\begin{defn}\n\tThe union $A \\cup B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all objects that are elements of at least one of $A$ and $B$. That is, $A \\cup B = \\{x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}.$\n\\end{defn}\nThus, $\\{4,8,9\\} \\cup \\{2,4,9,11\\} = \\{2,4,8,9,11\\}$ (we do not list the 4 or 9 twice, as elements cannot be duplicated in a set).\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\tThe intersection $A \\cap B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all objects that are elements of both of $A$ and $B$. In other words, $A \\cap B = \\{x \\;|\\; x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}.$\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, $\\{3,5,9,11\\} \\cap \\{2,5,8,11,13\\} = \\{5,11\\}$.\n\\begin{defn}\n\tTwo sets are mutually exclusive if and only if they have no intersection.\n\\end{defn}\nWe can also call two \\textit{events} mutually exclusive. For example, take the flipping of a coin. There are two possible outcomes, heads and tails, which are mutually exclusive because they cannot both occur at once. If two sets are mutually exclusive, we can say\n\\[A \\cup B = A + B\\]\n\\[A \\cap B = \\varnothing.\\]\n\n\\noindent We can use Venn diagrams to determine what the intersection and union of multiple sets may be.\n\\begin{example}\n\tA survey of 100 people finds that 60 people own a car, 30 people own a house, and 20 people own both. How many people own a house or a car, but not both?\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    Let $C$ be the set of those who own a car, and $H$ be those who have a house. Then, $C \\cap H$ is the set of people who own both. Since $n(C) = 60, n(H) = 30,$ and $n(C \\cap H) = 20,$ we can find the number of people who own a house or a car without the intersection. This is the same as $(C \\cap H)'$. We can use a Venn diagram:\n\n    \\def\\firstcircle{(0,0) circle (1.5cm)}\n    \\def\\secondcircle{(0:2cm) circle (1.5cm)}\n    \n    \\colorlet{circle edge}{bordGreen}\n    \\colorlet{circle area}{bkgGreen}\n    \n    \\tikzset{filled\/.style={fill=circle area, draw=circle edge, thick},\n        outline\/.style={draw=circle edge, thick}}\n        \n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}\n        \\draw[filled, even odd rule] \\firstcircle node {$C$}\n                                     \\secondcircle node{$H$};\n        \\node[anchor=south] at (current bounding box.north) {$({C \\cap H})'$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    This makes it obvious. If we add the two together, we have $C + H = 90$. This, however, overcounts for the middle region. If we subtract $C \\cap H,$ we have the union of $C$ and $H$. Then, subtracting again from that, we have $(C \\cap H)'$, which is what we wanted! Thus, $(C \\cap H)' = 90 - 20 - 20 = \\boxed{50.}$\n\\end{solution}\n\n\\noindent This actually gives us an interesting theorem, which we call \\textit{the Union Rule}.\n\\begin{thrm}[Union Rule]\n\tThe union $A \\cup B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is equal to their sum minus their intersection, such that $A \\cup B = A + B - (A \\cap B)$.\n\\end{thrm}\nSee the above example for a proof.\n\\begin{corr}[Intersection Rule]\n\tThe intersection $A \\cap B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is equal to their sum minus their union, such that $A \\cap B = A + B - (A \\cup B)$.\n\\end{corr}\nThis comes as a result of the Union Rule. Next, the \\textit{empty set}, denoted $\\varnothing$, $\\emptyset$, or $\\{\\},$ is the set of no elements. That is, we define $\\varnothing$ as all sets such that $\\not\\exists a \\in \\varnothing.$\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\tThe sets $A_1, A_2,...,A_n$ are \\textit{mutually disjoint} if and only if $A_1 \\cap A_2\\cap...\\cap A_n \\equiv \\varnothing.$\n\\end{defn}\nFor example, if $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $B = \\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$, since $A \\cap B = \\varnothing,$ $A$ and $B$ are mutually disjoint. This is also true for infinite sets, so we can say $\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ is mutually disjoint with $\\mathbb{R}^{-}$.\n\n\\subsubsection*{Probability}\nWith the notions of sets in mind, we can start discussing basic probability concepts.\n\\begin{defn}\n\tThe probability $P$ of an event $A$, denoted $P(A)$, is equal to the ratio of the event space $\\textbf{E}$ and sample space $\\textbf{S}$, such that\n\t\\[P(A) = |\\mathbf{E}_A|\/|\\mathbf{S}|.\\]\n\\end{defn}\n\nWe'll define the sample space as the total \\textit{possible} outcomes, and the event space as the outcomes which fit our constraints. We denote the size of the event space as $|\\mathbf{E}|$. Going back to the flipping of a fair coin, our sample space is $\\mathbf{S} = \\{\\text{heads, tails}\\}$, so the size of the sample space is $|\\mathbf{S}| = 2$. If I wanted to know $P($heads$)$, we can call the event space $\\mathbf{E} = \\{\\text{heads}\\},$ so $|\\mathbf{E}| = 1$. Then, our probability is their ratio, $1\/2$.\n\nThis is a slightly complicated way of expressing a simple topic, but it helps to make things rigorous.\n\n\\begin{example}\n    Two six-sided dice are rolled. Find the probability that their sum is between 4 and 6, inclusive.\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    First, our sample space is all possible configurations of the two dice. Let the die be in pairs, so that $(1,2)$ refers to a 1 on the first and a $2$ on the second. Then we have $\\vb{S} = \\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),...(2,1),(2,2),..., (6,5), (6,6)\\}$. This gives $36$ possible configurations.\n    \n    Then, the event space is all configurations which match. Here, we want the sum to be 4, 5, or 6. In that case, we have $\\mathbf{E}_4 = \\{(1,3), (3,1), (2,2)\\}$, $\\mathbf{E}_5 = \\{(1,4), (4,1), (2,3), (3,2)\\}$, $\\mathbf{E}_6 = \\{(1,5), (5,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3, 3)\\}$. Therefore, $|\\mathbf{E}| = \\Sigma |\\mathbf{E}_x| = 12$. Thus, we have that the overall probability is $P = 12\/36 = 1\/3 = 33.333\\%$.\n\\end{solution}\n\n\\noindent Finally, there are some basic probability rules we should discuss.\n\n\\begin{defn}\n    Two events are \\textit{independent} if the occurrence of one does not influence the other.\n\\end{defn}\n\nFor example, flipping two coins is an example of two independent events. On the other hand, drawing two cards without replacing the first is an example of two \\textit{dependent} events.\n\n\\begin{thrm}[Probability Rules]\n    The probability of two independent events, $A$ and $B$, both occurring is\n    \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A)\\times P(B).\\]\n    The probability of one of two independent events, $A$ or $B$, is\n    \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B).\\]\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{example}\n    What is the probability that, on rolling $2$ die, the first is a 6, and the second is odd?\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    First, we need to realize that the events are independent. Then, we need to compute the probability of each. Let $A =$ six and $B =$ odd. Then,\n    \\begin{align*}\n        P(A) &= \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n        P(B) &= \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2},\n    \\end{align*}\n    since $|\\vb{S}| = 6,$ $|\\vb{E}_A| = 1,$ and $|\\vb{E}_B| = 3$. Then, we multiply their probabilities to find\n    \\[P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}},\\]\n    and we're done.\n\\end{solution}\n\n\\subsection*{Sets and Probability Problems}\n\\begin{problem}[10]\n    Sets $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements.

For example,\n\\begin{example}\n    I draw a card out of a deck. Then, I draw a second card, without replacing the first. What's the probability that both are kings?\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    For this, we need to calculate the first probability. This is pretty obviously $\\frac{4}{52},$ since there are $4$ kings in a deck. However, to calculate the probability of the second being a king, we need to figure out the new sample space and event space. Instead of $4$ and $52,$ if the first card was a king, then we have $|\\vb{E}| = 3$ and $|\\vb{S}| = 51$. This is because one card was drawn, and we're assuming that it was a king. Then,\n    \\[P = \\frac{3}{51}.\\]\n    Thus, we have\n    \\[P(\\text{both}) = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{52 \\cdot 51} = \\frac{12}{2652} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{221}},\\]\n    so we're done.\n\\end{solution}\n\n\\noindent This gives us the important idea of \\textit{conditional} probability.\n\n\\begin{defn}[Conditional Probability]\n    The probability of $B$ \\textit{given} $A$, notated $P(B\\mid A)$, is the probability that $B$ will occur, given that $A$ occurred.\n\\end{defn}\nSo in Example 4.5, we have that $P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{3}{51}$, whereas $P(B) = \\frac{4}{52}$. Essentially, $P(B \\mid A)$ is the probability of $B$ if $A$ actually happened.\n\nFrom the above example, we also have that $P(\\text{both}) = P(A)\\times P(B \\mid A)$. Thus,\n\\begin{thrm}\n    For two dependent events, $A$ and $B$,\n    \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A)\\times P(B \\mid A).\\]\n\\end{thrm}\nFinally, we can move on to the big theorem of this section.\n\n\\begin{thrm}[Bayes' Theorem]\n    For two dependent events $A$ and $B$,\n    \\[ P(A\\mid B)={\\frac {P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}}.\\]\n\\end{thrm}\nBayes' Theorem allows us to express $P(A \\mid B)$ in terms of $P(B \\mid A),$ which is a crucial tool, as you'll see. Since most problems involving conditional probability typically have multiple ways of getting to one outcome, Bayes' Theorem condenses all of them into one total probability.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    We know that\n    \\[P(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B\\mid A),\\]\n    and that\n    \\[P(B\\cap A) = P(B)P(A\\mid B),\\]\n    from Theorem 4.5. Then, we can equate these, giving\n    \\[P(A)P(B\\mid A) = P(B)P(A\\mid B).\\]\n    Therefore, we have\n    \\[P(A\\mid B)=\\frac {P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)},\\]\n    and we are done.\n\\end{proof}\\footnote{See \\url{https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U_85TaXbeIo} for a simple geometric proof.}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\noindent This also expands into\n\n\\begin{corr}[Expanded Bayes]\n    For two dependent events $A$ and $B$,\n    \\[P(A\\mid B)={\\frac {P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B\\mid A)P(A)+P(B\\mid A')P(A')}}.\\]\n\\end{corr}\nThis proof is one of the problems for this section.\n\nThe best way to solve these problems is through \\textit{tree diagrams}. These essentially map out all of the possible outcomes.\n\n\\begin{example}\n    $5.2\\%$ of people who get tested have a certain virus. The test for this virus has a $3\\%$ false negative rate, and a $98.4\\%$ true negative rate. Find the probability that if I test positive, I have the virus.\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    To solve this, we can first use a tree. Let $V = $ I have the virus, $P =$ I test positive, and $N =$ I test negative. Then,\n    \n    \\bigskip\n    \n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{forest}\n    [ [$V$ [$P$ ] [$N$ ] ] [$V'$ [$P$ ] [$N$ ] ] ]\n    \\end{forest}\n    \\end{center}\n    \n    \\bigskip\n    \n    We then can assign our probabilities to these values:\n    \n    \\bigskip\n    \n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{forest}\n    [ [{$V = 0.052$} [{$P$} ] [{$N = 0.03$} ] ] [{$V'$} [{$P$} ] [{$N = 0.984$} ] ] ]\n    \\end{forest}\n    \\end{center}\n    \n    \\bigskip\n    \n    Finally, we can calculate the missing probabilities, since $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$.\n    \n    \\bigskip\n    \n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{forest}\n    [ [{$V = 0.052$}  [{$P = 0.97$} ] [{$N = 0.03$} ] ] [{$V' = 0.948$} [{$P = 0.016$} ] [{$N = 0.984$} ] ] ]\n\t\\end{forest}\n    \\end{center}\n    \n    \\bigskip\n    \n    Now all that's left to do is apply Bayes' Theorem. Here, we'll use the expanded version. You'll notice that there are two possible ``routes\" to get to \\texttt{P} - through $V$ and through $V'$. We want to determine $P(V \\mid P),$ which entails using Expanded Bayes.\n    \\begin{align*}\n        P(V\\mid P) &= \\frac{P(P\\mid V)P(V)}{P(P\\mid V)P(V)+P(P\\mid V')P(V')} \\\\\n        &= \\frac{(0.97)(0.052)}{(0.97)(0.052) + (0.016)(0.948)} \\\\\n        &= \\boxed{76.88\\%},\n    \\end{align*}\n    and we're done.\n\\end{solution}\n\nYou'll notice that I essentially multiplied up the tree with my preferred route, then divided by the sum of every possible route.

The third, then, can be distributed in 9 ways, giving us $11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{990}$ total ways.\n\\end{solution}\n\nIn addition, we may want to consider the arrangement of items, both with repeated items, and without.\n\n\\begin{thrm}\n    If there are no repeats, there are $n!$ ways to \\textit{distinctly} arrange $n$ items. If there are repeats, there are\n    \\[\\frac{n!}{r_1!r_2!\\dots r_k!}\\]\n    ways to arrange $n$ items with $r_i$ repetitions of $i$.\n\\end{thrm}\n\\begin{proof}\n    We begin with the case of no repeats. Suppose there are $n$ ``slots\" in which to place these items.\n    \n    Without loss of generality, we start with the first slot. Since there are $n$ items, there are $n$ total possible arrangements. For the second slot, there are now $n-1$ total combinations, since one item has been used for the second slot. Likewise, for the third, $n-2$, and so on. Thus, for the $k$th slot, there are $n-k+1$ combinations. From the multiplication principle we then have\n    \\[\\prod_{k=1}^{n} (n-k+1) = n!,\\]\n    so we're done.\n    \n    For the case with repeats, suppose that we denote each repeated item with $A_i$. Suppose that we have $r_1$ repeats of $A$, $r_2$ repeats of $B$, and so on. WLOG, let all the $A$'s be placed together, all of the $B$'s, etc. We can represent the string of $A$'s with\n    \\[A_1A_2A_3\\dots A_{r_1}.\\]\n    From our original case, there are $r_1!$ ways to arrange this. The same goes for $B$, $C$, and the rest. If they are not arranged together, the logic still holds. Thus, since there are $n!$ non-distinct arrangements, and $r_1!r_2!\\dots r_k!$ ways to repeat (from the multiplication principle), we get\n    \\[\\frac{n!}{r_1!r_2!\\dots r_k!},\\]\n    which was to be proved.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{example}\n    How many ways can you arrange the letters in \\texttt{MISSISSIPPI}?\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    There are 11 letters in \\texttt{MISSISSIPPI}, giving us $11!$ nondistinct arrangements. Next, there are $4$ occurrences of \\texttt{S}, 4 of \\texttt{I}, and 2 of \\texttt{P}. Thus, there are \n    \\[\\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\\]\n    total arrangements of the word.\n\\end{solution}\n\n\\begin{defn}[Permutations]\n    When there are $n$ objects and $k$ ways to arrange them, there are\n    \\[_nP_k = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\]\n    total possibilities. We use these when \\textit{ordering matters}.\n\\end{defn}\n\\begin{remark}\n    This is often also written as $^nP_k,$ $P(n,k)$, or on calculators, \\texttt{nPr}$(n,k)$.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{example}\n    Six people are arranged in a line. How many ways can they be arranged if...\n    \\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, topsep = 1pt]\n        \\item There are no restrictions?\n        \\item A has to be at the front?\n        \\item B has to be at either end?\n        \\item C has to be next to D?\n        \\item E and F can't be next to each other?\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{example}\n\\begin{solution}\n    We'll take this piece by piece. Part 1 asks, essentially, to evaluate $_{6}P_{6},$ since there are $6$ spots and $6$ people. This gives\n    \\[_{6}P_{5} = \\frac{6!}{(6-6)!} = \\boxed{6!}.\\]\n    For part 2, we can effectively `fix' $A$ to the front - there is 1 way to do this. Then, we have $5$ spots left, which gives $5!$ arrangements, so we have $1 \\times 5! = \\boxed{5!}$.\n    \n    For part 3, there are two possible `good' outcomes. If we assume B is at the front, there are $5!$ permutations. If we assume B is at the end, there are another $5!$ permutations. Adding these gives us $\\boxed{2 \\times 5!}.$\n    \n    Parts 4 and 5 are left as exercises to the reader (I'm too lazy).\n\\end{solution}\n\nSometimes, however, we might experience \\textit{overcounting.} For example,\n\n\\begin{example}\n    There are 10 balls in a box. 6 are red, 4 are green. \n\\end{example}\n\n\\subsection*{Combinatorics Problems}\nThere are \\textit{alot} of these.

Then the middle term of the sequence must be $\\tfrac{715}{11} = 65$. Since the original sequence is arithmetic, the sum of the first, last, and middle term is simply \\[3 \\cdot 65 = \\boxed{195}.\\]","meta":{"level":"Level 3","type":"Intermediate Algebra"}}
