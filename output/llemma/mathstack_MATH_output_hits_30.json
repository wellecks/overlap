This is because the number of ways to add a certain number of ones to an assortment of $7$ ones is the same as the number of ways to take away a certain number of ones from an assortment of $7$ $6$s.\n\nSo, we can match up the values to find the sum with the same probability as $10$. We can start by noticing that $7$ is the smallest possible roll and $42$ is the largest possible roll. The pairs with the same probability are as follows:\n\n$(7, 42), (8, 41), (9, 40), (10, 39), (11, 38)...$\n\nHowever, we need to find the number that matches up with $10$. So, we can stop at $(10, 39)$ and deduce that the sum with equal probability as $10$ is $39$. So, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{39}}$, and we are done.\n\nWritten By: Archimedes15\n\n\n\nAdd-on by ike.chen: to see how the number of ways to roll $10$ and $39$ are the same, consider this argument:\n\nEach of the $7$ dice needs to have a nonnegative value; it follows that the number of ways to roll $10$ is $\\binom {10-1}{7-1}=84$ by stars and bars. $10-7=3$, so there's no chance that any dice has a value $>6$.\n\nNow imagine $7$ piles with $6$ blocks each. The number of ways to take $3$ blocks away (making the sum $7\\cdot 6-3=39$) is also $\\binom {3+7-1}{7-1}=84$.\n\n%\n\\item%\nLet's call the unknown value $x$. By symmetry, we realize that the difference between 10 and the minimum value of the rolls is equal to the difference between the maximum and $x$. So, \n\n$10 - 7 = 42- x$\n\n$x = 39$ and our answer is  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$\nBy: Soccer\\_JAMS\n\n%\n\\item%\nFor the sums to have equal probability, the average sum of both sets of $7$ dies has to be $(6+1)\\cdot 7 = 49$. Since having $10$ is similar to not having $10$, you just subtract 10 from the expected total sum. $49 - 10 = 39$ so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$\n\nBy: epicmonster\n\nRevised solution by Williamgolly (includes bijections):\nNotice that we first must have at least a 1 on each die.  Now, we form the following bijection: biject each value on the original die, say $x$ to a value $7-x$ on the new die. Notice how now we need to 'take away' 3 from seven dies that all show 6.  Therefore, the answer is 39.\n\n%\n\\item%\nThe expected value of the sums of the die rolls is $3.5\\cdot7=24.5$, and since the probabilities should be distributed symmetrically on both sides of $24.5$, the answer is $24.5+(24.5-10)=39$, which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$.\n\nBy: dajeff\n\n%\n\\item%\nAnother faster and easier way of doing this, without using almost any math at all, is realizing that the possible sums are ${7,8,9,10,...,39,40,41,42}$. By symmetry, (and doing a few similar problems in the past), you can realize that the probability of obtaining $7$ is the same as the probability of obtaining $42$, $P(8)=P(41)$ and on and on and on. This means that $P(10)=P(39)$, and thus the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 39}}$.\n\nBy: fhdsaukfaioifk\n\nCalculating the probability of getting a sum of $10$ is also easy.

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $2$, therefore their average is $1\\Rightarrow \\boxed{A}$.\n\n%\n\\item%\nWe know that for an equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{-b}{a}$. This means that the sum of the roots for $ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0$ is $\\frac{2a}{a}=2$. The average is the sum of the two roots divided by two, so the average is $\\frac22 = 1 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{A}$.\n\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n%\n\\section*{Problem 8}%\n\\label{sec:Problem8}%\n\\begin{enumerate}%\n\\item%\nSince $(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = x^2 + ax + b = 0$, it follows by comparing \\href{\/wiki\/index.php\/Coefficient}{coefficients} that $-a - b = a$ and that $ab = b$. Since $b$ is nonzero, $a = 1$, and $-1 - b = 1 \\Longrightarrow b = -2$. Thus $(a,b) = \\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}\\ (1,-2)}$.\n\nAnother method is to use \\href{\/wiki\/index.php\/Vieta%27s_formulas}{Vieta's formulas}. The sum of the solutions to this polynomial is equal to the opposite of the $x$ coefficient, since the leading coefficient is 1; in other words, $a + b = -a$ and the product of the solutions is equal to the constant term (i.e, $a*b = b$). Since $b$ is nonzero, it follows that $a = 1$ and therefore (from the first equation), $b = -2a = -2$. Hence, $(a,b) = \\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}\\ (1,-2)}$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are solutions to the given equation, we can write the two equations $a^2 + a^2 + b = 2a^2 + b = 0,$ and $b^2 + ab + b = 0.$ From the first equation, we get that $b = -2a^2,$ and substituting this in our second equation, we get that $4a^4 - 2a^3 - 2a^2 = 0,$ and solving this gives us the solutions $a = -\\frac{1}{2},$ $a = 0$ and $a = 1.$ We discard the first two solutions, as the first one doesnt show up in the answer choices and we are given that $a$ is nonzero. The only valid solution is then $a = 1,$ which gives us $b = -2,$ and $(a, b) = \\boxed{\\text{(C) } (1, -2)}$\n\nNote that for roots $a$ and $b$, $ab = b$. This implies that $a$ is $1$, and there is only one answer choice with $1$ in the position for $a$, hence, $(a,b) = \\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}\\ (1,-2)}$\n\n%\n\\item%\n\\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/5QdPQ3__a7I?t=498}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/5QdPQ3\\_\\_a7I?t=498}\n\n~ pi\\_is\\_3.14\n\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n%\n\\section*{Problem 9}%\n\\label{sec:Problem9}%\n\\begin{enumerate}%\n\\item%\nWe can see that $44^2=1936$ which is less than 2020. Therefore, there are $2020-44=1976$ of the $4040$ numbers greater than $2020$. Also, there are $2020+44=2064$ numbers that are less than or equal to $2020$. \n\nSince there are $44$ duplicates\/extras, it will shift up our median's placement down $44$. Had the list of numbers been $1,2,3, \\dots, 4040$, the median of the whole set would be $\\dfrac{1+4040}{2}=2020.5$. \n\nThus, our answer is $2020.5-44=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$.\n\n~aryam\n\n~Additions by BakedPotato66\n\n%\n\\item%\nAs we are trying to find the median of a $4040$-term set, we must find the average of the $2020$th and $2021$st terms.\n\nSince $45^2 = 2025$ is slightly greater than $2020$, we know that the $44$ perfect squares $1^2$ through $44^2$ are less than $2020$, and the rest are greater. Thus, from the number $1$ to the number $2020$, there are $2020 + 44 = 2064$ terms. Since $44^2$ is $44 + 45 = 89$ less than $45^2 = 2025$ and $84$ less than $2020$, we will only need to consider the perfect square terms going down from the $2064$th term, $2020$, after going down $84$ terms. Since the $2020$th and $2021$st terms are only $44$ and $43$ terms away from the $2064$th term, we can simply subtract $44$ from $2020$ and $43$ from $2020$ to get the two terms, which are $1976$ and $1977$. Averaging the two, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}.$\n\n~\\href{\/wiki\/index.php\/User:Emerald_block}{emerald\\_block}\n\n%\n\\item%\nWe want to know the $2020$th term and the $2021$st term to get the median.\n\nWe know that $44^2=1936$. So, numbers $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots,44^2$ are in between $1$ and $1936$.\n\nSo, the sum of $44$ and $1936$ will result in $1980$, which means that $1936$ is the $1980$th number.\n\nAlso, notice that $45^2=2025$, which is larger than $2021$.\n\nThen the $2020$th term will be $1936+40 = 1976$, and similarly the $2021$th term will be $1977$.\n\nSolving for the median of the two numbers, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$\n\n~toastybaker\n\n%\n\\item%\nWe note that $44^2 = 1936$, which is the first square less than $2020$, which means that there are $44$ additional terms before $2020$. This makes $2020$ the $2064$th term. To find the median, we need the $2020$th and $2021$st term. We note that every term before $2020$ is one less than the previous term (That is, we subtract $1$ to get the previous term.). If $2020$ is the $2064$th term, than $2020 - 44$ is the $(2064 - 44)$th term. So, the $2020$th term is $1976$, and the $2021$st term is $1977$, and the average of these two terms is the median, or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$.\n\n~primegn\n\n%\n\\item%\nTo find the median, we sort the $4040$ numbers in decreasing order, then average the $2020$th and the $2021$st numbers of the sorted list.\n\nSince $45^2=2025$ and $44^2=1936,$ the first $2021$ numbers of the sorted list are \\[\\underbrace{2020^2,2019^2,2018^2,\\ldots,46^2,45^2}_{1976\\mathrm{ \\ numbers}}\\phantom{ },\\phantom{ }\\underbrace{2020,2019,2018,\\ldots,1977,1976}_{45\\mathrm{ \\ numbers}}\\phantom{ },\\] from which the answer is $\\frac{1977+1976}{2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\n%\n\\item%\n\\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/luMQHhp_Rfk}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/luMQHhp\\_Rfk}\n\nEducation, The Study of Everything\n\n%\n\\item%\n\\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZGwAasE32Y4}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZGwAasE32Y4}\n\n~IceMatrix\n\n%\n\\item%\n\\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/B0RPkcjdkPU}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/B0RPkcjdkPU}\n\n~savannahsolver\n\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n%\n\\section*{Problem 10}%\n\\label{sec:Problem10}%\n\\begin{enumerate}%\n\\item%\n\\[\\begin{split}& (n+1)n! + (n+2)(n+1)n! = 440 \\cdot n! \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &n![n+1 + (n+2)(n+1)] = 440 \\cdot n! \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &n + 1 + n^2 + 3n + 2 = 440 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &n^2 + 4n - 437 = 0\\end{split}\\]\n\nSolving by the quadratic formula, $n = \\frac{-4\\pm \\sqrt{16+437\\cdot4}}{2} = \\frac{-4\\pm 42}{2} = \\frac{38}{2} = 19$ (since clearly $n \\geq 0$).

The answer is $1 + 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }10}$.\n\nDividing both sides by $n!$ as before gives $(n+1)+(n+1)(n+2)=440$. Now factor out $(n+1)$, giving $(n+1)(n+3)=440$. By considering the prime factorization of $440$, a bit of experimentation gives us $n+1=20$ and $n+3=22$, so $n=19$, so the answer is $1 + 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }10}$.\n\nSince $(n+1)! + (n+2)! = (n+1)n! + (n+2)(n+1)n! = 440 \\cdot n!$, the result can be factored into $(n+1)(n+3)n!=440 \\cdot n!$ and divided by $n!$ on both sides to get $(n+1)(n+3)=440$. From there, it is easier to complete the square with the quadratic $(n+1)(n+3) = n^2 + 4n + 3$, so $n^2+4n+4=441 \\Rightarrow (n+2)^2=441$.

Since $a,c,b$ is geometric, $c^2=ab=(2b-c)b \\Rightarrow 2b^2-bc-c^2=(2b+c)(b-c)=0$. Since $a<b<c$, we can't have $b=c$ and thus $c=-2b$. Then our arithmetic progression is $4b,b,-2b$. Since $4b < b < -2b$, $b < 0$. The smallest possible value of $c=-2b$ is $(-2)(-1)=2$, or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$.\n\n(Solution by AT)\n\n%\n\\item%\nTaking the definition of an arithmetic progression, there must be a common difference between the terms, giving us $(b-a) = (c-b)$. From this, we can obtain the expression $a = 2b-c$. Again, by taking the definition of a geometric progression, we can obtain the expression, $c=ar$ and $b=ar^2$, where r serves as a value for the ratio between two terms in the progression. By substituting $b$ and $c$ in the arithmetic progression expression with the obtained values from the geometric progression, we obtain the equation, $a=2ar^2-ar$ which can be simplified to $(r-1)(2r+1)=0$ giving us $r=1$ or $r=-1\/2$. Thus, from the geometric progression, $a=a$, $b=1\/4a$ and $c=-1\/2a$. Looking at the initial conditions of $a<b<c$ we can see that the lowest integer value that would satisfy the above expressions is if $a = -4$, thus making $c=2$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ \n(Solution by thatuser)\n\n%\n\\item%\nBy the definition of an arithmetic progression, we can label the terms $a$, $b$, and $c$, as $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$. Now, we have that $a$, $a+2d$, and $a+d$ form a geometric progression. Since a geometric ratio has a common ratio between terms, we have $(a+2d)\/a = (a+d)\/a+2d$. Cross multiplying, we obtain the equation $(a+2d)^2=a(a+d)$. Multiplying it out and cancelling terms, we are left with the quadratic equation $4d^2+3ad=0$. Solving for $d$ in terms of $a$, we get that $d=-3a\/4$ or $d=0$. Looking at the problem, we know that the $d$ cannot be 0, therefore the arithmetic progression is $a, a\/4, -a\/2$, so we need to find the minimum value of $-a\/2$ while $-a\/2>a$. Looking at our progression, we realize that a must be a multiple of 4 so that every term is an integer.

Therefore, since the other two probabilities have to both the same, they have to be $\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{3}}{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\nSuppose the green ball goes in bin $i$, for some $i \\ge 1$. The probability of this occurring is $\\frac{1}{2^i}$. Given that this occurs, the probability that the red ball goes in a higher-numbered bin is $\\frac{1}{2^{i+1}} + \\frac{1}{2^{i+2}} + \\ldots = \\frac{1}{2^i}$ (by the geometric series sum formula). Thus the probability that the green ball goes in bin $i$, and the red ball goes in a bin greater than $i$, is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2^i}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4^i}$. Summing from $i=1$ to infinity, we get\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^i} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{3}}\\]\nwhere we again used the geometric series sum formula. (Alternatively, if this sum equals $n$, then by writing out the terms and multiplying both sides by $4$, we see $4n = n+1$, which gives $n = \\frac{1}{3}$.)\n\nFor red ball in bin $k$, $\\Pr(\\text{Green Below Red})=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{k-1}2^{-i}$ (GBR) and $\\Pr(\\text{Red in Bin k}=2^{-k}$ (RB). \n\\[\\Pr(\\text{GBR}|\\text{RB})=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{\\infty}2^{-k}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{k-1}2^{-i}=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{\\infty}2^{-k}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1-(1\/2)^{k-1}}{1-1\/2})\\]\n\\[\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2^{-k}}-2\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{(2^2)^{-k}}\\implies 1-2\/3=\\boxed{(\\textbf{C}) \\frac{1}{3}}\\]\n\nThe probability that the two balls will go into adjacent bins is $\\frac{1}{2\\times4} + \\frac{1}{4\\times8} + \\frac{1}{8 \\times 16} + ... = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{6}$ by the geometric series sum formula. Similarly, the probability that the two balls will go into bins that have a distance of $2$ from each other is $\\frac{1}{2 \\times 8} + \\frac{1}{4 \\times 16} + \\frac{1}{8 \\times 32} + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{256} + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{12}$ (again recognizing a geometric series). We can see that each time we add a bin between the two balls, the probability halves. Thus, our answer is $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\cdots$, which, by the geometric series sum formula, is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{3}}$.\n-fidgetboss\\_4000\n\nDefine a win as a ball appearing in higher numbered box.\n\nStart from the first box. \n\nThere are $4$ possible results in the box: Red, Green, Red and Green, or none, with an equal probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for each. If none of the balls is in the first box, the game restarts at the second box with the same kind of probability distribution, so if $p$ is the probability that Red wins, we can write $p = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}p$: there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability that \"Red\" wins immediately, a $0$ probability in the cases \"Green\" or \"Red and Green\", and in the \"None\" case (which occurs with $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability), we then start again, giving the same probability $p$. Hence, solving the equation, we get $p = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\nWrite out the infinite geometric series as $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\cdots$. To find the probablilty that red goes in a higher-numbered bin than green, we can simply remove all odd-index terms (i.e term $1$, term $3$, etc.), and then sum the remaining terms - this is in fact precisely equivalent to the method of Solution 2. Writing this out as another infinite geometric sequence, we are left with $\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\frac{1}{64}, \\cdots$. Summing, we get \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^i} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{3}}\\]\n\nFixing the green ball to fall into bin $1$ gives a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{2^3} +...\\right)$ for the red ball to fall into a higher bin. Fixing the green ball to fall into bin $2$ gives a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{2^4} +...\\right)$. Factoring out the denominator of the first fraction in each probability gives $\\frac{1}{2^3}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2^2}+...\\right)+\\frac{1}{2^5}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2^2}+...\\right)+...$ so factoring out $\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{2^3}+...\\right)$ results in the probability simplifying to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{2^5}+\\frac{1}{2^7}+...\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{2^3}+...\\right)$ and using the formula $\\frac{a}{1-r}$ to find both series, we obtain $\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2^3}}{1-\\frac{1}{4}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)$ which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{3}}$ -- OGBooger\n\nWe can think of this problem as \"what is the probability that the green ball's bin is less than the red ball's bin\". We do not consider the case where the red ball goes into bin $1$ because the green ball has no where to go then. The chance that the green one is below the red one if the red one goes to bin $2$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the red ball even goes in bin $2$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance that the green ball goes into any bin less than $2$. Similarly, if the red goes into bin $3$, there is a $\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ chance, or $\\frac{3}{32}$, continuing like this, we get this sequence:\n\n$\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3}{32}, \\frac{7}{128}, ...$\n\nLet $S$ equal the sum of our series:\n\n$S = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{3}{32} + \\frac{7}{128} + ...$. That means we can write another equation:\n$\\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{3}{128} + ...$\n\nSubtracting $\\frac{S}{4}$ from $S$, yields:\n\n$S - \\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{32} + \\frac{4}{128} + ...$\n\nWe see that the above series is a infinite geometric sequence with common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the sum of that infinite series is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{2}}$, which equals $\\frac{1}{4}$. Our equation is now $S - \\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Solving for $S$ shows that $S = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nOur answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{3}}$\n\n~ericshi1685\n\nDenote $G,R$ the bin numbers of the green and red balls, respectively. The common probability distribution of $G,B$ can be constructed by keep splitting the remaining unassigned probability into two halves: one goes to the smallest number that has not been assigned, and the other goes to the rest. In other words, $\\Pr(G=k) = \\Pr (G>k), \\forall k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then,\n\n\\[\\Pr(G>R)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\Pr(G>k) \\Pr(R=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\Pr(G=k) \\Pr(R=k) = \\Pr (G=R)\\]\n\nSimilarly $\\Pr(G<R)=\\Pr(G=R)$. Therefore all three probabilities equal $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n~asops\n\n%\n\\item%\nFor those who want a video solution: \\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/VP7ltu-XEq8}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/VP7ltu-XEq8}\n\n\\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/_0YaCyxiMBo?t=353}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/\\_0YaCyxiMBo?t=353}\n\n~IceMatrix\n\n\\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/IRyWOZQMTV8?t=2484}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/IRyWOZQMTV8?t=2484}\n\n~ pi\\_is\\_3.14\n\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n%\n\\section*{Problem 17}%\n\\label{sec:Problem17}%\n\\begin{enumerate}%\n\\item%\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{asy}\n\timport olympiad; import cse5;   size(8cm,8cm); path circ1, circ2; circ1=circle((0,0),5); circ2=circle((3,4),3); pair O, Z; O=(3,4); Z=(3,-4); pair [] x=intersectionpoints(circ1,circ2); pair [] y=intersectionpoints(x[1]--Z,circ2); pair B; B=midpoint(x[1]--y[0]); draw(B--O); draw(x[0]--Z); draw(O--Z); draw(x[1]--Z); draw(O--x[0]); draw(circ1); draw(circ2); draw(rightanglemark(Z,B,O,15)); draw(x[1]--O--y[0]); label(\"$O$\",O,NE); label(\"$Y$\",x[0],SE); label(\"$X$\",x[1],NW); label(\"$Z$\",Z,S); label(\"$A$\",y[0],SW); label(\"$B$\",B,SW);\n\\end{asy}\n\\end{center}\n\n%\n\\item%\nLet $r$ denote the radius of circle $C_1$. Note that quadrilateral $ZYOX$ is cyclic. By Ptolemy's Theorem, we have $11XY=13r+7r$ and $XY=20r\/11$. Let $t$ be the measure of angle $YOX$. Since $YO=OX=r$, the law of cosines on triangle $YOX$ gives us $\\cos t =-79\/121$. Again since $ZYOX$ is cyclic, the measure of angle $YZX=180-t$. We apply the law of cosines to triangle $ZYX$ so that $XY^2=7^2+13^2-2(7)(13)\\cos(180-t)$. Since $\\cos(180-t)=-\\cos t=79\/121$ we obtain $XY^2=12000\/121$.

Both of these triangles have the same circumcircle ($C_2$). From the Extended Law of Sines, we see that $\\frac{r}{\\sin{\\angle{OZY}}} = \\frac{r}{\\sin{\\angle{OZX}}}= 2R$.

Pulling an altitude to $XY$ from $O$, we obtain $\\cos(\\angle{OXY}) = \\frac{10}{11}$. Since quadrilateral $ZYOX$ is cyclic, we have $\\angle{OXY}=\\angle{OZY}$, so $\\cos(\\angle{OXY}) = \\cos(\\angle{OZY})$. Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle $OZY$, we obtain $\\frac{10}{11} = \\frac{7^2+11^2-r^2}{2(7)(11)}$.

Let $A$ be the point of intersection of $C_1$ and $XZ$. We now have $AZ=YZ=7$ and $XA=6$. Furthermore, notice that $\\triangle XAO$ is isosceles, thus the altitude from $O$ to $XA$ bisects $XZ$ at point $B$ above.

Notice that $\\angle YZO=\\angle XZO$ as they subtend arcs of the same length. Let $A$ be the point of intersection of $C_1$ and $XZ$. We now have $AZ=YZ=7$ and $XA=6$. Consider the power of point $Z$ with respect to Circle $O,$ we have $13\\cdot 7 = (11 + r)(11 - r) = 11^2 - r^2,$ which gives $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{30}}.$\n\n%\n\\item%\nNote that $OX$ and $OY$ are the same length, which is also the radius $R$ we want. Using the law of cosines on $\\triangle OYZ$, we have $11^2=R^2+7^2-2\\cdot 7 \\cdot R \\cdot \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle formed by $\\angle{OYZ}$. Since $\\angle{OYZ}$ and $\\angle{OXZ}$ are supplementary, $\\angle{OXZ}=\\pi-\\theta$. Using the law of cosines on $\\triangle OXZ$, $11^2=13^2+R^2-2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot R \\cdot \\cos(\\pi-\\theta)$. As $\\cos(\\pi-\\theta)=-\\cos\\theta$, $11^2=13^2+R^2+\\cos\\theta$. Solving for theta on the first equation and substituting gives $\\frac{72-R^2}{14R}=\\frac{48+R^2}{26R}$. Solving for R gives $R=\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\boxed{\\sqrt{30}}$.\n\n%\n\\item%\nWe first note that $C_2$ is the circumcircle of both $\\triangle XOZ$ and $\\triangle OYZ$. Thus the circumradius of both the triangles are equal. We set the radius of $C_1$ as $r$, and noting that the circumradius of a triangle is $\\frac{abc}{4A}$ and that the area of a triangle by Heron's formula is $\\sqrt{(S)(S-a)(S-b)(S-c)}$ with $S$ as the semi-perimeter we have the following, \\begin{align*}\\dfrac{r \\cdot 13 \\cdot 11}{4\\sqrt{(12 + \\frac{r}{2})(12 - \\frac{r}{2})(1 + \\frac{r}{2})(\\frac{r}{2} - 1)}} &= \\dfrac{r \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11}{4\\sqrt{(9 + \\frac{r}{2})(9 - \\frac{r}{2})(2 + \\frac{r}{2})(\\frac{r}{2} - 2)}} \\\\ \\dfrac{13}{\\sqrt{(144- \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 1)}} &= \\dfrac{7}{\\sqrt{(81- \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 4)}} \\\\ 169 \\cdot (81 - \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 4) &= 49 \\cdot (144 - \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 1) .\\end{align*}\nNow substituting $a = \\frac{r^2}{4}$, \\begin{align*}169a^2 - (85) \\cdot 169 a + 4 \\cdot 81 \\cdot 169 &= 49a^2 - (145) \\cdot 49 a + 144 \\cdot 49 \\\\ 120a^2 - 7260a + 47700 &= 0 \\\\ 2a^2 - 121a + 795 &= 0 \\\\ (2a-15)(a-53) &= 0 \\\\ a = \\frac{15}{2}, 53.\\end{align*}\nThis gives us 2 values for $r$ namely $r = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot \\frac{15}{2}} = \\sqrt{30}$ and $r = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 53} = 2\\sqrt{53}$.\n\nNow notice that we can apply Ptolemy's theorem on $XOYZ$ to find $XY$ in terms of $r$. We get \\begin{align*}11 \\cdot XY &= 13r + 7r \\\\ XY &= \\frac{20r}{11}.\\end{align*}\nHere we substitute our $2$ values of $r$ receiving $XY = \\frac{20\\sqrt{30}}{11}, \\frac{40\\sqrt{53}}{11}$. Notice that the latter of the $2$ cases does not satisfy the triangle inequality for $\\triangle XYZ$ as $\\frac{40\\sqrt{53}}{11} \\approx 26.5 > 7 + 13 = 20$.

Note that angle bisectors of triangle $ABC$ are concurrent at the center $O$(also $I$) of circle $C$. Let $x=QB$, $y=RC$ and $z=AS$. Note that $BR=x$, $SC=y$ and $AQ=z$. Hence $x+z=27$, $x+y=25$, and $z+y=26$. Subtracting the last 2 equations we have $x-z=-1$ and adding this to the first equation we have $x=13$. \n\nBy Heron's formula for the area of a triangle we have that the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\sqrt{39(14)(13)(12)}$. On the other hand the area is given by $(1\/2)25r+(1\/2)26r+(1\/2)27r$.  Then $39r=\\sqrt{39(14)(13)(12)}$ so that $r^2=56$.\n\nSince the radius of circle $O$ is perpendicular to $BC$ at $R$, we have by the pythagorean theorem $BO^2=BI^2=r^2+x^2=56+169=225$ so that $BI=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 15}$.\n\n%\n\\item%\nWe can use mass points and Stewart's to solve this problem.

Which means that $\\overline{BB'}$ is split into a $2:1$ ratio. We can then use Stewart's to find $\\overline{BB'}$.

First, notice that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt{39(39 - 27)(39 - 26)(39 - 25)} = 78\\sqrt{14}$. Therefore, using the formula that $sr = A$, where $s$ is the semi-perimeter and $r$ is the length of the inradius, we find that $r = 2\\sqrt{14}$. \n\nDraw radii to the three tangents, and let the tangent hitting $BC$ be $T_1$, the tangent hitting $AB$ be $T_2$, and the tangent hitting $AC$ be $T_3$. Let $BI = x$. By the pythagorean theorem, we know that $BT_1 = \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$. By POP, we also know that $BT_2$ is also $\\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$. Because we know that $BC = 25$, we find that $CT_1 = 25 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$. We can rinse and repeat and find that $AT_2 = 26 - (25 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}) = 1 + \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$. We can find $AT_2$ by essentially coming in from the other way. Since $AB = 27$, we also know that $AT_3 = 27 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$.

We can change the equation into $1 + A = 27 - A$, which we find $A$ to be $13$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{x^2 - 56} = 13$, which further implies that $x^2 - 56 = 169$.

For Debra to see the second tail before the second head, her first flip can't be heads, as that would mean she would either end with double tails before seeing the second head, or would see two heads before she sees two tails. Therefore, her first flip must be tails. The shortest sequence of flips by which she can get two heads in a row and see the second tail before she sees the second head is $THTHH$, which has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\frac{1}{32}$. Furthermore, she can prolong her coin flipping by adding an extra $TH$, which itself has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since she can do this indefinitely, this gives an infinite geometric series, which means the answer (by the geometric series sum formula) is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{32}}{1-\\frac{1}{4}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{24}}$.\n\n%\n\\item%\nNote that the sequence must start in THT, which happens with $\\frac{1}{8}$ probability. Now, let $P$ be the probability that Debra will get two heads in a row after flipping THT. Either Debra flips two heads in a row immediately (probability $\\frac{1}{4}$), or flips a head and then a tail and reverts back to the \"original position\" (probability $\\frac{1}{4}P$). Therefore, $P=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}P$, so $P=\\frac{1}{3}$, so our final answer is $\\frac{1}{8}\\times\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{24}}$.   -Stormersyle\n\n%\n\\item%\n\\href{https:\/\/youtu.be\/wopflrvUN2c?t=993}{https:\/\/youtu.be\/wopflrvUN2c?t=993}\n\n\\href{https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2f1zEvfUe9o}{https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2f1zEvfUe9o}\n\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n%\n\\section*{Problem 23}%\n\\label{sec:Problem23}%\n\\begin{enumerate}%\n\\item%\nLet $x$ be the \\href{\/wiki\/index.php\/Probability}{probability} of rolling a $1$.

First, let's find the area of the triangle formed by the midpoint of the sides. Notice, this is an equilateral triangle, thus all we need is to find the length of its side. \nTo do this, we look at the isosceles trapezoid outside this triangle but inside the outer hexagon. Since the interior angle of a regular hexagon is $120^\\circ$ and the trapezoid is isosceles, we know that the angle opposite is $60^\\circ,$ and thus the side length of this triangle is $1+2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos 60^\\circ\\right)=1+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}.$ So the area of this triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2=\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{16}.$\n\nNow let's find the area of the smaller triangles. Notice, $\\triangle ACE$ cuts off smaller isosceles triangles from the outer hexagon. The base of these isosceles triangles is perpendicular to the base of the isosceles trapezoid mentioned before, thus we can use trigonometric ratios to find the base and height of these smaller triangles, which are all congruent due to the rotational symmetry of a regular hexagon. The area is then $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos 60^\\circ\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin 60^\\circ\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{32}$ and the sum of the areas is $3\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{32}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{32}.$\n\nTherefore, the area of the convex hexagon is $\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{16}-\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{32}=\\frac{18\\sqrt{3}}{32}-\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{32}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac {15}{32}\\sqrt{3}}.$\n\n%\n\\item%\nIf we try to coordinate bash this problem, it's going to look very ugly with a lot of radicals.
